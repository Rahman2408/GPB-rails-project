Group Project Builder

##Objective -Provide a platform for users to submit, keep track of, and build on ideas for a project they'd like to start where other users can build on one's project by adding features and vice versa.

##Description -This rails-based web app is called "Group Project Builder" and is ultimately a way for users to add and build on projects or ideas they choose to do or contribute to. Most people suggest to write things down,but that can only go so far whether you eventually forget about it, or just drop the idea due to a lack in motivation. What makes G.P.B the ideal place to start is that an idea can still be yours but also contributed to and expanded in ways you may have never thought of. When you start and idea, or "project", it remains yours with a cemented timestamp, but can be built on by others with similar interests or mindsets or vice versa. Take an idea you find worth putting out there, let it progress with a community of similar individuals, and watch it evolve into something big and worth making real.

##Instructions

Run 'bundle install' in your terminal.

Run 'rails db:migrate' in your terminal migrate from ActiveRecord, create the data tables.

Lastly, run 'rails s' in your and vist "localhost:3000" in your browser, or alternatively, run 'rackup config.ru' in your terminal and visit "localhost:9292" in your browser. Either works but the important detail is the to look for the PORT number value. That is the number that should go after "localhost: " in your browser.

Whenenver finished, just press "ctrl + c" while in your terminal before exiting out and the server should stop.
